The goal of this project is to discover, as a whole, the software platform that you have chosen (Java, .NET, node.js) through the creation of a business application.<br/>
To do this, you must implement a software suite that functions similar to that of IFTTT and / or Zapier. This software suite will be broken into three parts :<br/>
- An application server to implement all the features listed below (see Features)
- A web client to use the application from your browser by querying the application server
- A mobile client to use the application from your phone by querying the application server

No business process will be performed on the web &amp; mobile client side, which only serves as a user interface and redirects requests from / to the application server.
